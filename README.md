### Fight the new Evil Santa boss! This gives you the brand new Snowball Staff that will allow you to shoot the new snowballs at three times the rate! Killing the boss also releases the entrapped Christmas spirits and allows Santa to spawn around in the overworld, who will give you gifts if you feed him cookies and have a Christmas Tree around!
